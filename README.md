## ARte
**ARte** (Augmented Reality to educate) is a smartphone **application** for the *Sapienza University of Rome*'s [Arte Classica Museum](https://web.uniroma1.it/polomuseale/museo-arte-classica) that aims to improve the **interaction** between users and **artworks**.
Accessing to the app website, visitors will be able to perform various functionalities on their device in order to toggle features based on the **Augmented Reality** technology.  

At the same time, after an explicit agreement of the user, several data are anonymously collected to preserve **privacy** via **crowdsensing** and several **ARM Cortex boards**. Such data are then displayed on a **dashboard** website to allow museum managers to analyze them for statistical purposes.  


## Contents
- [Design](Design.md): a document that shows some details on the product/service from the user point of view.
- [Architecture](Architecture.md): a document that includes details on the technical aspects of the product/service, including a high-level presentation of the conceptual architecture of the software and hardware components that make up the product/service, a description of the main software/hardware components, how these components interact and a network architecture.
- [Evaluation](Evaluation.md): a document that provides details on how to evaluate the product/service, from a user experience point of view and from a technical point of view. The document needs to describe the evaluation methodology for both the overall system as well as each individual components for the technical/user dimensions.
- [Presentation]() of the product/idea and the evaluation plan.
- [Presentation]() of the technical approach and architecture.
